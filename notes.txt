# Content Updates

- Added EWWF, a massive new set of mechanics to transform the game and make it less of a boring grind
- Added skills, a feature that makes power more interesting and worthwhile
- Added 5 new combat units, 2 new farming units, 2 new misc units, and something that can autosend next waves to speed up progress. All of these units are more quirky and unique to allow for more strategy diversity - also needs more skill to properly use these
- Added so many new upgrades I can't even keep track

# General Changes

- Removed doom upgrade, antimatter drops start at wave 101 (reason being that doom constantly messed up code)
- Removed righteous ascensions and instead added stronger upgrades so the difficulty curve eases into 201 more naturally

# Bug Fixes

- Pausing should no longer erase existing projectiles
- Reaching wave 200 naturally without spawning the boss before 200 should no longer crash the game

# UI/QOL

- Enemy health bars now display both health and max health

# Balance Changes

## [-] Nerf [+] Buff (relative to player ease)

## Units
[+] All farming units gain more production power per wave

## Upgrades
[-] All upgrades in the Meditation tree nerfed by 1% damage per farm
[-] Meditation caps per upgrade reduced from [40, 90, 150, 250, 500] to [40, 60, 100, 200, 500]
[+] Swapped STEAM Architects to the front of the STEAM line to have it better scale into the later game

## Misc
[+] Max projectile speed reduced from 50 to 40 so there's less projectiles "skipping" over enemies
